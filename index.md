Look at [Karl's tutorial](http://kbroman.org/simple_site/)

With [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), you just write things in
[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[GitHub](http://github.com) hosts the site for you, and you just push
material to your GitHub repository with `git add`, `git commit`, and
`git push`.

The sites use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), a
[ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) [gem](https://rubygems.org/), to
convert Markdown files to html, and this part is done
automatically when you push the materials to the `gh-pages` branch
of a GitHub repository.

The [GitHub](http://pages.github.com) and
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) documentation is great, but I thought it
would be useful to have a minimal tutorial
